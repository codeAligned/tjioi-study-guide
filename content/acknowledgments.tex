\chapter{Acknowledgments}

We'd like to thank our faculty sponsor, Mr. Thomas Rudwick, for his tireless efforts in helping us plan the event, along with the countless times we've used his room for lunch meetings. We'd also like to thank Mrs. Nicole Kim for her guidance and wisdom from having sponsored TJ IOI in the past, as well as Mr. Stephen Rose for helping us with finances and contacting other schools. Furthermore, we'd like to thank Dr. Evan Glazer, our principal, and the entire TJ Computer Science Department, for creating a wonderful environment where we can foster our passion for computer science.

We'd also like to thank the authors of the Crash Course Coding Companion, from which we took some inspiration and many diagrams: Samuel Hsiang, Alexander Wei, and Yang Liu. Their guide is available online at \url{https://github.com/alwayswimmin/cs_guide}.

Last but not least, we'd like to thank the officers and others who made TJ IOI possible in 2012 and 2013, whose work we are certainly building upon in this study guide as well as in other aspects. We would not be where we are without their efforts. A special shoutout goes to William Luo Qian, who essentially came up with the idea for TJ IOI from scratch, and who has kept in touch with us throughout this entire process. We hope to carry on their legacy in TJ IOI 2017.
