\chapter{Preface}

The Thomas Jeffersion Intermediate Olympiad in Informatics (TJ IOI) is a high-school computer science competition, to be held on Saturday, May 13, 2017, at TJHSST.  We hope to be able to share our passion for computer science with our peers, in hopes of inspiring our fellow students through exposure to concepts not usually taught in the classroom.  In order to help our participants gain a bit of background before the event, we have created a study guide to help ensure that students are equipped with the tools they need to be successful.  If any mistakes are found in this study guide, or if you simply have questions, do not hesitate to contact us at \href{mailto:tjioiofficers@gmail.com}{tjioiofficers@gmail.com}.

We'd like to thank Mr. Thomas Rudwick, our faculty sponsor, for his tireless efforts in helping us plan the event, along with the countless times we've used his room for lunch meetings. We'd also like to thank Mrs. Nicole Kim for her guidance and wisdom from having sponsored TJ IOI in the past, as well as Mr. Stephen Rose for making sure our planning was airtight. Finally, we'd like to thank Dr. Evan Glazer, our principal, and the entire TJ Computer Science Department, for creating a wonderful environment where we can foster our passion for Computer Science.

We hope that you find this study guide useful, and we look forward to seeing you at TJ IOI 2017!
