\chapter{Preface}

The Thomas Jefferson Intermediate Olympiad in Informatics (TJ IOI) is a high-school computer science competition, to be held on Saturday, May 13, 2017, at TJHSST.  We hope to be able to share our passion for computer science with our peers, in hopes of inspiring our fellow students through exposure to concepts not usually taught in the classroom.  In order to help our participants gain a bit of background before the event, we have created a study guide to help ensure that students are equipped with the tools they need to be successful.

The majority of the material in this study guide is covered in the curriculum of AP Computer Science A, and we hope that the material will be useful as a review for those of you enrolled in that class. That being said, certain additional sections are not covered; namely, those related to trees, graph theory, and dynamic programming. As a result, these sections will account for \textbf{no more than $\frac{1}{4}$ of the points} in the competition.

We'd love to discuss how we can help you use this study guide effectively as a student, or as part of a computer science club. If you think there are errors or things we could improve, we'd certainly like to know about those too. Please don't hesitate to contact any of the officers individually, or send an email to \href{mailto:tjioiofficers@gmail.com}{tjioiofficers@gmail.com}.

We hope that you find this study guide useful, and we look forward to seeing you at TJ IOI 2017!
